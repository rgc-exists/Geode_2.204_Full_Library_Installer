# Geode 2.204 Full Library Installer

Install Geode and the ENTIRE library at the time for 2.204 Geometry Dash.

## Meant ONLY for GDPSes that are stuck on 2.204.

**Running this on a GDPS _(or the original game)_ with a later version of geode will _replace the config file for 2.206+ Geode._, EVEN IF the exe file is in a different location than you normal play on.**

# FOR INSTALLING 2.204 WITH THE FULL LIBRARY, _WITHOUT CHANGING YOUR CONFIG FILE_, DOWNLOAD THE [ZIP FILE WITH THE FULL LIBRARY IN IT](https://github.com/rgc-exists/Geode_2.204_Installer/raw/refs/heads/master/geode-v2.0.0_withAllMods.zip?download=) AND INSERT CONTENTS INTO THE SAME FOLDER AS YOUR GeometryDash.exe EQUIVALENT.

# FOR INSTALLING 2.204 ON ITS OWN, WITHOUT THE ENTIRE LIBRARY, DOWNLOAD THE [OFFICIAL v2.0.0 RELEASE ON GITHUB](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.27)
